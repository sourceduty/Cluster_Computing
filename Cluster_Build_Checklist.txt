- [ ] Performance Goals: (e.g., throughput, latency, scalability)

2. Hardware Configuration

- [ ] Nodes:
  - [ ] Number of Nodes: [Specify Count]
  - [ ] Node Type: (e.g., general-purpose servers, GPU-equipped machines, ARM-based devices)
- [ ] Processors:
  - [ ] CPU Type: [Specify Model/Type]
  - [ ] Number of Cores per Node: [Specify Count]
- [ ] Memory:
  - [ ] RAM per Node: [Specify Size]
- [ ] Storage:
  - [ ] Local Storage: [Specify Size and Type]
  - [ ] Shared Storage: (e.g., NAS, SAN, parallel file system)
- [ ] Networking:
  - [ ] Network Interface: (e.g., Gigabit Ethernet, InfiniBand)
  - [ ] Bandwidth Requirements: [Specify Mbps/Gbps]

3. Software Stack

- [ ] Operating System: (e.g., Linux distribution, Windows Server)
- [ ] Cluster Management Software:
  - [ ] Resource Manager: (e.g., SLURM, Kubernetes, Apache Mesos)
  - [ ] Provisioning Tools: (e.g., Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes Helm)
- [ ] Middleware:
  - [ ] Message Passing Interface (MPI): (e.g., OpenMPI, MPICH)
  - [ ] Storage Solutions: (e.g., Lustre, Ceph, HDFS)
- [ ] Application Software:
  - [ ] Pre-installed Libraries: (e.g., NumPy, TensorFlow, SciPy)
  - [ ] Specialized Frameworks: (e.g., PyTorch, Spark, Hadoop)

4. Networking Architecture

- [ ] Network Topology: (e.g., star, ring, mesh)
- [ ] Switch Configuration: [Specify Switch Specs and Count]
- [ ] Latency Considerations: [Specify Thresholds]
- [ ] Redundancy Requirements: [Specify Failover Plan]

5. Cluster Setup and Deployment

- [ ] Node Configuration:
  - [ ] Install OS on all nodes.
  - [ ] Configure hostname and IP addresses.
- [ ] Networking:
  - [ ] Set up private and public network interfaces.
  - [ ] Enable secure communication between nodes (e.g., SSH keys).
- [ ] Cluster Management Setup:
  - [ ] Install and configure resource manager.
  - [ ] Test job scheduling and task distribution.
- [ ] Storage Integration:
  - [ ] Mount shared storage on all nodes.
  - [ ] Configure backups and redundancy mechanisms.
- [ ] Application Deployment:
  - [ ] Distribute software dependencies across nodes.
  - [ ] Set up containerized environments (optional).

6. Performance Optimization

- [ ] Load Balancing: (e.g., hardware-based, software-based)
- [ ] Resource Allocation: (e.g., CPU, GPU, memory quotas)
- [ ] Monitoring Tools: (e.g., Nagios, Prometheus, Grafana)
- [ ] Scaling Strategy:
  - [ ] Vertical Scaling: (e.g., add resources to nodes)
  - [ ] Horizontal Scaling: (e.g., add more nodes)

7. Testing and Validation

- [ ] Run Benchmark Tests: (e.g., LINPACK, SPEC CPU)
- [ ] Evaluate Fault Tolerance: (e.g., simulate node failures)
- [ ] Monitor Network Performance: (e.g., ping, traceroute, iperf)

8. Documentation and Maintenance

- [ ] Maintain Cluster Inventory: (e.g., node specs, roles)
- [ ] Keep Configurations Versioned: (e.g., Git repository)
- [ ] Establish Routine Maintenance Schedule:
  - [ ] System Updates
  - [ ] Hardware Checks
  - [ ] Log Review
